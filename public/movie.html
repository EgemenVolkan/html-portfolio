 <h1>The Best Movies According To Egemen</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies off all-time.</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Eyes Wide Shut</h3>
 <p>It's a tremendous Kubrick piece that changed my perspective.</p>
 <h3>The Shining</h3>
 <p>It is a work that I can call the bottom point of suspense and fear, and this is also Kubrick's signature.</p>
 <h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
 <p>Perhaps it is an impressive film that most of us are familiar with by eyeing the poster.</p>
